# Zomboid Delete Cell (ZDC)
A simple bash script to help linux server administrator to soft delete cells and related files save data, to install new map mods or to wipe those map area.

The script need to be placed in Zomboid folder.

Affected save data will be moved to a backup folder at "Zomboid/backups/zdc". You can simply move those files back if you made a mistake.

It is important to note that you might want to also delete map_zone.bin to reload the zone information. I do not know if there are any side effect doing so.
